# echilon-dotfiles

A collection of custom configuration files (dotfiles) for the **Hyprland** Wayland compositor, managed by **Echilon & Tonekneeo**.

---

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### Fresh Install & Liability

**THIS IS FOR A FRESH INSTALL OF VANILLA ARCH HYPRLAND.** Do not attempt this on derivative distributions (like CachyOS or similar).

This configuration is currently "vibe coded" and is in active development. While everything is working so far, **more testing will be done — use at your own risk.**

### Credits

The application bar (`noctalia-shell-git`) is based on the amazing work by Noctalia. All credit for the bar goes to them:

## ⚙️ Customization Required

These dotfiles are provided as a *template*. You **must** review and customize several files to match your system paths, desired aesthetics, and hardware setup.

### Key Customization Points:

| File/Section | Customization Needed | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`hypr/hyprland.conf`** | Monitor setup (resolution, scaling, refresh rate). | Current config uses `monitor=,preferred,auto,1`. You can also use `nwg-displays` to configure and export settings. |
| **`hypr/keybindings.conf`** | Script execution paths. | Ensure the paths to executable scripts (like `keyhints` or other utility scripts) are correct. |
| **Wallpaper Engine** | Custom wallpaper assets and workshop path. | View the [linux-wallpaperengine GitHub](https://github.com/Almamu/linux-wallpaperengine) for details. **🚨 I WILL NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR WALLPAPER ENGINE 🚨** |
| **Theming** | Color schemes and font settings. | Default theme settings are minimal. Add your preferred settings here. |
| **`fastfetch/config.jsonc`** | Theming/Images. | Update for specific image or ASCII art display. |
