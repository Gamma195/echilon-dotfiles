# echilon-dotfiles

A curated collection of custom configuration files (dotfiles) for the **Hyprland** Wayland compositor, maintained by Echilon & tonekneeo & Nyte.

---

## ⚠️ Important Warnings & Disclaimer

### Fresh Install Requirement

**This configuration is tailored for a FRESH INSTALL of VANILLA ARCH LINUX with Hyprland.** We strongly advise against attempting this installation on derivative distributions (such as CachyOS, Manjaro, etc.) as package and configuration conflicts are highly likely.

### Development Status

This configuration is in **active development** and is currently being "vibe coded." While all components are functional during testing, we advise using it **at your own risk**. More rigorous testing is scheduled.

### Credits

The primary application bar (`noctalia-shell-git`) is based on the exceptional work by **Noctalia**. All credit for the bar's design and functionality goes to them:

## ⚙️ Customization Required

These dotfiles are provided strictly as a **template**. You **must** review and customize several files to align with your specific hardware, desired aesthetics, and system paths.

| File/Section | Customization Needed | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`hypr/hyprland.conf`** | Monitor setup (resolution, scaling, refresh rate). | The current default is `monitor=,preferred,auto,1`. You may use `nwg-displays` to help configure and export precise settings. |
| **`hypr/keybindings.conf`** | Script execution paths. | **Crucial:** Ensure the absolute paths to executable scripts (e.g., `keyhints`, custom utility scripts) are correct for your system. |
| **Wallpaper Engine** | Custom wallpaper assets and workshop path. | Refer to the [linux-wallpaperengine GitHub](https://github.com/Almamu/linux-wallpaperengine) for details. **🚨 NO SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED FOR WALLPAPER ENGINE 🚨** |
| **Theming** | Color schemes, fonts, and global aesthetic settings. | The default theme is minimal. Customize these files to add your preferred color palette and font stack. |
| **`fastfetch/config.jsonc`** | Theming/Images. | Update the configuration for your specific image or ASCII art display. |

## 🚀 Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

You must be running an **Arch-based Linux distribution** and have basic development tools installed (`git` is required for cloning).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and clone the repository using `git`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Echilonvibin/echilon-dotfiles.git
```

### Step 2: Run the Installation Script
Navigate into the cloned directory and execute the automated install.sh script:
cd ./echilon-dotfiles

```bash
./install.sh
```
Note: The install.sh script handles package installation via your package manager and deploys the dotfiles, creating a backup of any existing configuration files it overwrites.

# 🗑️ Uninstallation
If you need to revert the changes and restore your system to its previous state using the created backups, please follow these steps.

### Step 1: Run the Uninstallation Script
Navigate to the repository directory (if not already there) and execute the uninstall.sh script:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

### Step 2: Manually Remove Software (Optional)
The uninstallation script restores configurations but does not remove packages. If you wish to completely remove the installed software, you must run a separate command using your package manager (e.g., yay, pacman).

# Example command to remove core packages (adjust the list as needed)
```
yay -R nautilus noctalia-shell-git upscayl-bin video-downloader gnome-calculator loupe gcolor3 protonplus mission-center
```
